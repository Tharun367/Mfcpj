<h1>About Us Page</h1>
<p>Our Foundation is a not-for-profit, non-governmental organization
started to promote organ donation in Chennai by philanthropists and
medical professionals . It is a registered NGO with Income Tax
exemption under Section 80G and 35AC and has offices in Chennai,
Hyderabad, Delhi-NCR, Chandigarh, Nagpur, Jaipur, Mumbai and
USA. Our Foundation was started by a group of like-minded and
concerned medical and non-medical professionals committed to
increasing the reach of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act.
The
Government of India passed this act in 1994 to broaden the concept of
organ donation and stop commercial dealings in organs, especially
kidneys. It is now possible to not only donate one’s eyes, but also
other
vital organs like the heart, lungs, liver, pancreas and kidneys.</p>
<p>The mission of our Foundation is to ensure that every Indian who
is suffering from end stage organ failure be provided with the 'gift of
life’ through a life-saving organ</p>
