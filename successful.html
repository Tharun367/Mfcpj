<p>Saying thank you is as much about the writer as it is about the 
reader. It is a social grace that benefits both parties equally, a real 
means 
to nurture the human spirit. Personally, saying thank you allows me to 
reflect on my blessings and helps me remember to be kind to others. 
Organ donation is no exception to this rule, and perhaps quite to the 
contrary, it is a powerful reminder how wonderful gift giving and 
receiving truly is.
The death of a family member is one of the most difficult experience 
we face. But in the midst of pain and grief, many families make a 
brave 
decision to help others who are critically ill through an organ 
donation. 
Knowing first-hand how the organ recipient's life has changed and 
what 
they have been able to do since getting a transplant can help give 
meaning to the senselessness surrounding their loss. Sharing such 
uplifting information can both help the organ recipient with their 
recovery, as well as help the donor family through their grieving 
process.
All this to say that actually writing your letter is not an easy task. It is 
difficult to find a proper beginning and deciding on what to say. I also 
remember feeling uneasy about contacting a family who had suffered 
a 
tragic loss while my father was alive and well. However, by and large, 
I believed that donor families do want to hear from their loved ones' 
recipients as it would be quite natural to wonder who the recipient is 
and how he/she is recovering from their illness. People have an innate 
need to know.</p>
